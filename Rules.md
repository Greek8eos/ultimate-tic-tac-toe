1. Player 1 picks the local board and position he/she wants to start from
2. Player 2 must play the local board decided by the previous player, but can play anywhere inside that local board. (Repeated until a victor of a local board)
3. Once a local board has a winner, the game is either over (1 Local board), or the victor can choose the next local board and position to play from (3 Local Boards) [similar to two players starting a game]
4. If at any point a local board is filled with no discernable winner (tie), the board is cleared of all characters (reset to a netural state)
5. If a local board is won by Player 1 or Player 2, the board is completely filled with the winner's matching color
